### **Estrutura Avançada de Dados – Advanced Data Structure**

Problem of horizontal displacement of an object at a constant speed.
The program should determine the distance covered by the object.

## Evaluation Project - Part I
The solution to be implemented must allow representing and manipulating simulation scenarios. For each scenario
should consider the code (unique identifier) and the values of the associated variables. The solution should
obligatorily represent all the information regarding the simulation scenarios through a list
double bonded circular .

## Evaluation Project - Part II
The solution to be implemented must allow representing and manipulating simulation scenarios. For each scenario
should consider the code (unique identifier) and the values of the associated variables. The solution should
obligatorily represent all the information regarding the simulation scenarios through a tree
binary search .

The operations to be made available are as follows:
- **Insertion of a new scenario** – This feature should allow registering the code of a new
scenario as well as the values of the associated variables;
- **Searching a scenario by code** – After reading the scenario code to search, this functionality
must present all the information of the respective scenario;
- **Listing of scenarios in ascending code order** - After selection, a
listing all scenarios in ascending code order;
- **Changing a scenario** – After reading the scenario code, it should be displayed on the entire console
the information relating to the scenario. The user can then indicate the data(s) you want
change and then enter the new data(s);
- **Removal of a scenario** – After reading the scenario code, the record for the respective scenario
should be deleted;
- **Simulation of a scenario** – After reading the scenario code, present the values resulting from the
simulation of the scenario, with a time interval of 1 second, highlighting the minimum values and
maximums reached by each variable;
- **Storage of scenarios** – This feature should allow you to store the scenarios in a way
permanent in text file;
- **Loading of scenarios** – This feature should allow loading of all the information
stored in a text file.
